## Hello, I'm Jayme!

<p style="font-size: 1.2em; line-height: 1.5;">
    Having spent the past decade igniting a passion for Math in students, I recently completed the Data Science Immersive bootcamp at General Assembly Singapore. 
  While I love to simplify complex topics and share data-driven insights, I'm also drawn to the intricacies of machine learning and optimizing models. 
  I'm eager to leverage this blend of skills to contribute meaningful work and make a positive impact.
